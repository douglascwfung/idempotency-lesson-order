# Why Pass Domain Work as a Lambda

Lesson 12 put the idempotency key and the Order write in one transaction. The key is inserted already as `COMPLETED`. There is no `IN_PROGRESS` row. Lesson 13 keeps that design and makes the call shape explicit: the Order work is a lambda passed into the key method.

## What the key method owns

`IdempotencyService.runOrReplay` is the key method. It opens the transaction. It hashes `userId + path + rawBody`. It inserts the key, handles a primary-key race (replay a completed response or reject a hash mismatch), stores the response body, and commits or rolls back. That is the key lifecycle. It does not create Orders or add lines by name.

## What the caller supplies

The caller passes a work callback — a lambda such as `() -> orderService.create(request)` or `() -> orderService.addLine(id, request)`. The key method invokes that lambda inside the open transaction. Create and add-line share the same claim, race, replay, and hash rules without duplicating them.

## One transaction boundary

Because the lambda runs inside the key method's `@Transactional` box, a success commits the `COMPLETED` key and the Order rows together. A failure under the lambda rolls the flushed key and any Order work back together. A retry finds no key and can start fresh. Nested `@Transactional` on Order service methods joins that box under default `REQUIRED` propagation.

## Why this helps later

Complicated domain work stays outside the key method. A request that mixes adds and updates (sibling Lesson 8 style) can pass one lambda that performs all of those writes. Different endpoints can use different exception policies inside their own work without changing how the key is claimed or replayed. A new idempotent endpoint passes a new lambda; it does not copy `runOrReplay` wiring.

## Tradeoff

The call site is slightly harder to read at first. The Order write is no longer a direct statement inside the key method; it is a callback. That indirection is the cost of keeping key lifecycle and domain work separate so the single-transaction path stays reusable.
