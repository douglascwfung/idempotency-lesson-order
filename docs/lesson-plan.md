# Lesson Plan

## Lesson 1: Basic Order Aggregate and REST Endpoints

A user places an Order that owns a collection of Order Lines. Each line records a sku, quantity, and unit price. The application persists the Order and its lines and exposes create, get, and full-replace operations over HTTP.

### Learning Objectives

- Model a parent-child aggregate with an Order that owns OrderDetail lines.
- Persist the aggregate with Spring Data JPA and Flyway.
- Expose a REST controller that creates an Order, retrieves an Order by id, and replaces an Order's content.
- Verify controller behaviour with unit tests that mock the service.

### Key Concepts

An Order is the root of the aggregate. An OrderDetail exists only as part of an Order. The repository saves the Order. Cascade and orphanRemoval ensure that lines are saved and removed with the Order. The controller receives a request body and delegates to the service. The service constructs the domain objects and calls the repository.

### What You Will Build

- `Order` and `OrderDetail` entities under `lab.lesson.order.domain`.
- `OrderRepository` under `lab.lesson.order.repository`.
- `OrderService` under `lab.lesson.order.service`.
- `OrderController` under `lab.lesson.order.web` with create, get, and replace methods.
- Request and response records under `lab.lesson.order.web.dto`.
- A Flyway migration that creates the `orders` and `order_details` tables.
- Unit tests for `OrderController` that mock `OrderService`.

### Deliberate Design Decisions

The create operation always inserts a new Order. Repeated identical requests produce duplicate Orders. This behaviour is intentional for Lesson 1. Later lessons will introduce an idempotency key to prevent duplicates. No `@Transactional` annotation appears yet. No version column appears yet. The same-content in-progress check is appropriate for Orders because a user intends to place one Order. It is not appropriate for domains that allow duplicate content (for example, a machine-status log).

### Implementation Outline

1. Add the `Order` entity with a customer name and a list of `OrderDetail` lines.
2. Add the `OrderDetail` entity with sku, quantity, and unitPrice.
3. Create the Flyway migration `V1__create_order_tables.sql`.
4. Add `OrderRepository`.
5. Add `OrderService` with create, get, and replace methods. The create method always constructs and saves a new Order.
6. Add request and response records.
7. Add `OrderController` that maps POST `/orders`, GET `/orders/{id}`, and PUT `/orders/{id}`.
8. Add `OrderControllerTest` that mocks the service.

### Verify Your Work

Run the controller unit tests:

```
mvn -Dtest=OrderControllerTest test
```

The following methods must pass:

- `createDelegatesToServiceAndReturnsCreated`
- `getDelegatesToService`
- `replaceDelegatesToService`

Start the application and send two identical POST requests to `/orders`. Two distinct Orders appear in the database.

Example create request:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/orders \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "customerName": "Alice",
    "lines": [
      { "sku": "SKU-1", "quantity": 2, "unitPrice": 10.00 }
    ]
  }'
```

Repeat the same request. Both succeed and produce different ids.
